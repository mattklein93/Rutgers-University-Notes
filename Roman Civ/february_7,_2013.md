## Domestic and Personal Concerns
### Dinner
-	**Reclining** is the most important and most Roman aspects, along with coed dining. It was shown as freedom, as slaves ate sitting up. The left elbow placed up showed freedom also.
-	Unlike in Greek Dinners, men and women *did* dine together.
-	Square table was surrounded by three couches, one side is always left open. Whoever is sitting across this spot is the most important. The biggest issue was the space. 
-	Eggs were default appetizer.
-	Watering down the wine was to prevent alcoholism and to be proper.
-	Silver is used in vases because Silver was the most important.
-	Martial, and Juvinel wrote in a genre called Dinner Invitations.
-	**Garum** - anchovie based sauce.
-	**Apicius** - writer of the ancient Cookbook, similar to Hipocrates.
-	Upper class wanted to eat more and more exotic animals and fish (consider the highest delicacy)
-	Food info from Aetheneas, who wrote about a fake dinner party. Most is from elite sources, so the information from the regular citizens came from archaeology.

### Medicine and Illness
-	No sharp division between amateurs and professionals.
-	Medicine was a hobby for upper class.
-	Cicero describes Dysentery from a Roman Banquet.
-	As much as possible, use **regiment**. **Regiment** means to rely on diet and exercise.
-	For medicine, best source is Pliny the Elder. He speaks of folk remedies and more of the modern remedies.
	-	For example, eating manure to make a potion.
	-	To cure broken bones[^1]
	-	On strains and bruises[^2], use wild boar manure. Rumor has it Nero used this idea.

#### Medical Training and Practice
-	From an "independent study".
-	For example[^3], Martial writes about how someone changed his profession to a doctor[^4].
-	Womens medicine from Soranus[^5], also speaks of gynecology.
-	Tools used were: probes, lancets, spearhead-like, large knife, smaller knife, needle, an elevator (to raise depressed parts of the skull), hair pulling from the roots, long stick for extraction, tooth extraction,

### Death
-	Most important passage[^6] about the funeral from Polybius.
-	Carried into the Forum and Rostra, then someone speaks about who died, a mask is made of the person's face and whoever is wearing the mask wears a purple toga. Everyone who is wearing one they ride in a chariot. At the Rostra, it is displayed as a role model. Essentially a parade. Young men are inspired to endure o suffer anything for the common good.

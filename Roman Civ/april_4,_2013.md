## Roman Military and Army
-	Best description of a Roman Triumph is Zonaras.
-	Empire showed further professionalization of the army. The early empire saw the final establishment of a regular army, paid in cash, often supplied and maintained.
-	Manpower problem.
-	If you have people who have no farms to go to and count on the general, and owe allegiance it creates a big political problem. Helps with Marius' reforms (which changed politics and the army).
-	3 Phases - Republic before Marius, Repbulic after Marius, Empire.
-	Gaius Marius is development 1.
-	Development 2 is the Empire. Still had 25 Legions (5000 people). Auxilaries were not citizens, taken from anywhere.
-	We know a lot about the soldiers from the diplomita.

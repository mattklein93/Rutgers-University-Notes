## Assignment 4
-	Write miniature programs.

Instruction|zf|sf|of
------|-|-|-
addl  |y|y|y
subl  |y|y|y
andl  |y|y|`0`
xorl  |y|y|`0`
mull  |y|y|y
readb |y|`0`|`0`
readw |y|`0`|`0`

-	Y signifies a 1 or a 0 depending on the outcome (the operation effects it), and `0` shows it is 0 afterward.
-	Ignore `cmovXX` instructions. Extra credit if you implement it.
-	In implemetation, the `.size` tells the size and initial pointer to stack pointer. Our y86 registers are offsets into this space.
-	Extra credit: If you want to do division, make a division instruction.
-	Six different stages for computation. $$$M_4$$$ grab 4 byts. $$$M_n$$$ grab n bytes.

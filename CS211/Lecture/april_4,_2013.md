## Processor Design
-	ISA - Instruction Set Architecture is the interface between software and hardware.
-	Software compiled to ISA, Hardware supports execution of ISA.
-	We approach by introduce a simplified ISA (Y86).
	-	Modeled after x86.
	-	Extremely Simple.
-	Program registers
	-	Same 8 as with IA32. Each 32 bits.
-	Condition Codes
	-	Single bit flags set by arithmetic or logical instructions
	-	OF: Overflow. ZF: Zero. SF: Negative.
-	Program Counter
-	Memory
	-	Addresses in chunk of memory
	-	Byte-addressable storage array.
	-	Words stored in little-endian byte order.
	
### Instructions

Mnemomic	|	Meanining
---------|----
nop			|	no effect
halt		|	stop execution
rrmovl rA, rB|	rB <- rA
irmovl V, rB |	rB<- V
rmmovl rA, D(rB) | Mem[rB + D] <- rA
mrmovl D(rA), rB |	rB <- Mem[rA +D]
OPI rA, rB		 |	rB <- rB OP rA (OP one of +, - and xor) Set condition codes appropriately
jXX Dest		|	PC <- Dest (XX one of unconditional, le, l, e)
call Dest		|	Invoke function at Dest (same as x86)
ret				|	Return from function (same as x86)
pushl rA		|	%esp <- %esp -4; mem[%esp] <- rA
popl rA			|	rA <- Mem[%esp]; %esp <- %esp +4
Read/Write Byte or Long	|	Byte here \| Register \| Displacement
readb d(rA)		|	00 rAF	D
readl d(rA)		|	01 rAF	D
writeb d(rA)	|	D0 rAF 	D
writel d(rA)	|	D1 rAF	D

### Program Structure
-	Program starts at address 0.
-	Must set up stack.

	```
	irmovl Stack, %esp
	rrmovl %esp, %ebp
	irmovl List, %edx
	```	
	-	Make sure don't overwrite code!
-	Must initialize data.
-	Can use symbolic names.

### Memory Layout
Address	|	What's in it
----|--
0x0000	|	Main Program
		|	Array List
		|	len2
0x1000	|	Stack $$$\uparrow$$$
Max Address |	

### Encoding Registers
-	Each register has 4-bit ID

Register	|	Num
-|-
%eax	|	0
%ecx	|	1
%edx	|	2
%ebx	|	3
%esi	|	6
%edi	|	7
%esp	|	4
%ebp	|	5

-	Register ID 8 or (F) indicates "no register".

### A Y86 Processor
###### 	State
-	Program counter register (PC).
-	Instruction memory/register (holds current instruction).
-	Condition code register (CC).
-	Register File.
-	Memory.

###### 	Divide Fetch-Decode-Execute into a number of regular stages.
-	Fetch-Decode-Execute implies this already.
-	Break into slightly finer grain.
-	Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write Back, PC.

Step	|	Action
-|-
Fetch	|	Read instruction from memory
Decode	|	Read operand registers
Execute	|	Compute value or address
Memory	|	Read/write data from/to main memory
Write Back	|	Write destination register
PC		|	Update program counter

###### 	Building Blocks
-	Combinatorial logic (decoder, mux, adder, etc.).
-	Storage (registers, bits (flip-flops)).

###  C Bitfields
```
struct BFExample {
	unsigned int	f1:10;
	unsigned int	f2: 3;
	unsigned int	  : 4;
	unsigned int	f3: 7;	
	unsigned in		b:1;
}

bfexample a;
A.F1 = 1000;
```
-	Dangerous how the bits are remained, is dependant on code. Bitfields can overlap word boundaries.
-	Are they right to left or left to right in memory.
-	Don't do array bitfield.

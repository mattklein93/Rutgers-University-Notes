## Digimon Logic I
-	Transistor's are the building block of computers.
-	Microprocessors contain millions of transistors.
-	Every transistor is a switch.
-	We build these out of AND, OR, NOT.

### Transistors
-	**MOS transistor** - Metal Oxide Semiconductor. Has 4 components, a source, drain, gate, and a body. Current flows from the source to the drain, the gate decides if current can flow to the drain.
-	Two kinds of transistors, N-type and P-type. 
	-	N-type: If the circuit has a positive value it is closed. If it is zero, it is open (no current flows).
	-	P-type: if positive no current flows. If zero it is closed.
-	**CMOS transistor** - Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. Has 4 components, a source, drain, gate, and a body. Current flows from the source to the drain, the gate decides if current can flow to the drain. Uses both p-type and n-type.
-	**NOR and NAND** - not or and not and.

#### Logic Gates

-	**Logic Gates** - We build AND, OR, NOT out of transistors.
-	We can take any truuth table with AND, OR, NOT.

#### DeMorgan's Law and Logic Gates
![DeMorgan's Law - Logic](http://www.ustudy.in/sites/default/files/images/De-marg%20f%20law.PNG)

-	We can convert AND to OR with NOT, and OR to AND with NOT.
-	Negation of a conjuction is a disjunction of the negations.
-	Negation of a disjunction is a conjuction of the negations.
-	ANY gate can be implemented using either NOR or NAND gates. This is important becuase when building a chip it becomes easier.

-	AND and OR can have any number of inputs.

-	We can use this to become a decoder, a multiplexer (MUX), Full Adder,

#### Half Adder
-	**Half Adder** - adds two binary digits. The outputs are a sum digit and a carry digit.
	-	Sum = $$$\lnot AB+A \lnot B$$$
	-	Carry = AB

***
#### Full Adder	
-	**Full Adder** - adds binary numbers and deals with an input carry value and an output carry value. Has three inputs.
	-	Sum = $$$A \lnot B \lnot C + \lnot AB \lnot C + \lnot A \lnot B C + ABC$$$
	-	Carry Out = $$$AB+BC+AC$$$

##### Multi-Bit Adder
-	We can cascade full adders together to make more size adders.

### Circuit Design
1.	Derive a truth table for this circuit
2.	Derive a Boolean expression for the truth table
3.	Build a circuit given the Boolean expression
	-	Building the circuit involves mapping the Boolean expression to actual gates. This part is easy.
	-	Deriving the Boolean expression is easy. Deriving a good one is tricky.

#### Truth Table to Boolean Expression
-	Given a circuit isolate the rows in which te output of the circuit should be *true*.

	![Circuit Example](http://openbookproject.net/electricCircuits/Digital/14065.png)
	
-	A product term that contains exactly one instance of every variable is called a **minterm** (Minimal Term)
-	Given the expression for each row, build a larger Boolean expression for the entire table.
	-	This is a **sum of products**.

	![Circuit Expression](http://openbookproject.net/electricCircuits/Digital/04364.png)
	
#### Approach One: Algebra
-	Simply use the rules of boolean logic:

	![Rules](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~newton/Classes/CS150sp98/lectures/week4_1/img010.GIF)

-	For example:

### Karnaugh Maps
-	A graphical technique to view minterms and how they releate.
-	The map is a diagram made up of squares, with each square representing a single minterm.
-	Minterms resulting in a 1 are marked as 1, all others are marked as 0.
-	For example:

	![2 Variable K-Map](http://openbookproject.net/electricCircuits/Digital/14096.png)
	
-	In higher maps, several variables occupy a given axis. The sequence of 1s and 0s follow a *gray code sequence* (Success members differ by only 1 bit).
	
	![3 Varialbe K-Map](http://openbookproject.net/electricCircuits/Digital/14093.png)
	
#### Gray Code
-	Binary numnber where succes members differ by only 1 bit.
-	Assigns to each set of contigous integers, or each member of a circular list, a word of symbols where adjacent words only differ by one symbol. In binary, it is 1 and 0.

	![Gray Code](https://i.cmpnet.com/pldesignline/2006/12/max-gc-03.gif)
	
```
return (num >> 1) ^ num;
```
-	An n bit gray code is a permuation of $$$0-2^{n-1}$$$.
-	The n-1 bit list is embedded in the first half of the n bit list.
-	Each predecessor is different by 1 bit.

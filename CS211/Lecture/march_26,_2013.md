## Assignment 4 - Cacheing
-	Dull as bones. 4th assignment might become fetch and execute.

## WII-view
-	12 Questions on the midterm.
-	Computer internals (ALU stuff), number conversions, conversions WITH radix (decimal point, but same in decimal, octal and binary), endian-ness, fix broken C code, 2 Assembly (reading, 32bit), gray binary code, call-stack, demorgan's laws, draw a circuit.
***

## Number Conversions with Radix
- Number in base 10 * the base the number is to the position left (positive) or right (negative) of decimal.

### Decimal
-	345.678
	-	Left Side:
		-	5 = $$$5*10^0$$$
		-	4 = $$$4*10^1$$$
		-	3 = $$$3*10^2$$$
	-	Right Side:
		-	6 = $$$$6*10^{-1}$$$
		-	7 = $$$7*10^{-2}$$$
		-	8 = $$$8x10^{-3}$$$
		
### Hexadecimal
-	A12.34B
	-	Left Side:
		-	A = $$$10*16^2$$$
***

## Gray Code
-	Starts with 0 and 1
-	Flip to 0 1 1 0
-	Add 0 0 1 1 infront so:

```
1bit	2bit
----    ----
0		00
1		01
		11
		10
```
-	Add 0's to top half 1's to botton half.
***
## Assembly Instructions
-	Go right to left, then destination.

```
Immediate - 
	$0x1F
	$-17
	$012
	
Absolute Addresses - This address
	0x8800
	
Indirect - Address of this register
	(%ecx)

Indirect With Fixed Displacement - Go to register, get address, take immediate away from it and get this
	-8(%ebp)
	
Indirect with Index Register - Add content of two registers, get that address
	(%eax,%ebx)
	
Indirect with Index Register and Fixed Displacement - Add content of two registers, get that address and add the displacement to it
	42(%ebp,%eax)
	
	addl $5,42(%ebp,%esp) - Add content of two registers, add displacement, and add 5 to that
	
	addl 42(%ebp,%esp),%ecx - Add content of two registers, add 42, then add to ecx and put in ecx.
	
Scaled Indirect - content of registers, multiply 1 2 4 or 8
	(,%eax,4) - The 4 must be 1 2 4 or 8
	
Scaled Indirect with Fixed Displacement - content of registers multiply 1 2 4 or 8 and add immediate
	8(,%eax,4)

Scaled Indirect with Index Register - Take second, multiply by 2, add to eax and take that address
	(%eax,%ebx,2)
	
Scaled Indirect with Index Register and Fixed Displacement - Take eax, multiply by 8, add to ebp, add 96 to that
	96(%ebp,%eax,8)
	
	
	subl 96(%ebp,%eax,8),%eax
	subl %eax, 96(%ebp,%eax,8)
	
	leal 96(%ebp,%eax,8),%ebx - Load Effective Address. Different than move, as here it is a calculation (not doing something to it). MOV would take that content and move it, not find the number of address.
```
-	Parenthesis is always memory.
-	Any of these can be source or destination **but not both**.
***

## Call-Stack
-	Stack grows from larger to lower addresses. Does not matter on endianness (just how the values are stored). Pushing is **subtrating**, popping is **add**. Frame pointer is ebp, save old ebp registers in previous stack frames. Check prologue and epilogue.
***

## Logic Gates
-	Negate by putting a circle beforehand. "Connecting" is a dot. Otherwise memorize them.
***
## Endianness
-	ABCD1234 -> 3412CDAB. Swap only the bytes **not the bits**.

## Program Stack
-	Stack grows from higher to lower addresses.
-	`%esp` or `%rsp` is our stack pointer. It points to the top and is implicatly used.

### Push


```
	pushw	reg16	%esp -= 2; %reg16->(%esp)	Decrement ESP by 2, push register 16 to esp
	pushw	mem16	%esp -= 2; mem16->(%esp)	Decrement ESP by 2, push memory 16 to esp
	pushw	imm16	%esp -= 2; imm16->(%esp)	Decrement ESP by 2, push immediate 16 to esp
	
	pushl	reg32	%esp -= 4; %reg32->(%esp)	Decrement ESP by 4, push register 32 to esp
	pushl	mem32	%esp -= 4; mem32->(%esp)	Decrement ESP by 4, push memory 32 to esp
	pushl	imm32	%esp -= 4; imm32->(%esp)	Decrement ESP by 4, push immediate 32 to esp
	
	pushq	reg64	%esp -= 8; %reg64->(%esp)	Decrement ESP by 8, push register 64 to esp
	pushq	mem64	%esp -= 8; mem64->(%esp)	Decrement ESP by 8, push memory 64 to esp
	pushq	imm64	%esp -= 8; imm64->(%esp)	Decrement ESP by 8, push immediate 64 to esp
```

### Pop


```
	popw	reg16	(%esp)->reg16; %esp += 2	Copy, then increment ESP
	popw	mem16	(%esp)->mem16; %esp += 2	Copy, then increment ESP
	
	popl	reg32	(%esp)->reg32; %esp += 4	Copy, then increment ESP
	popl	mem32	(%esp)->mem32; %esp += 4	Copy, then increment ESP	
	popq	reg64	(%esp)->reg64; %esp += 8	Copy, then increment ESP
	popq	mem64	(%esp)->mem64; %esp += 8	Copy, then increment ESP
```
-	Can't pop into an immediate.

### Takeaways
-	Can push things of different sizes. Therefore, we are responsible of popping things of the corresponding size.
-	From the program stack, we have something called the call stack (built from program stack). Call stack has stack frames/activation records. Each stack frame is one function call in C, which has formal parameters and automatic variables.
	-	These are specific to the function invocation. They can be different sizes, not just 2, 4, 8 bit. They are by the number of formal paramters and size, and number of automatic variables and size.
	-	Each stack frame needs a return address, where execution is resumed.
	-	We can use `%evp` or `%rvp` to point to most recently created stack frames.
	
```
	call	label		direct
	call	*operand	indirect
```

-	Return address is from the call. If we label it, it is hardcoded. The indirect call, can specificy memory or a register, pulls this memory and transfers control there.
-	A return instruction, 'ret' goes to to the top of the program stack, pops an address off the program stack, and returns control to that address.

### Prologue and Epilogue
#### Prologue

```
	pushl	%ebp
	movl	%esp, %ebp
```
-	Prologue is what sets up the stack frame

#### Epilogue

```
	movl	%ebp, %esp			|
	popl	%ebp				|	Leave in asssembly, but is less efficient.
	ret							|
```

### Stack-Based Languages
-	A **reentrant** function is one that uses itself before it has completed, wth automatic variables.
-	For example, wiht swap, it is proploug,, body, epilogue.

### Parameter Passing
-	Calling functions will pace things to pass through register. Last think we push will be pointer to format strings. We push them in right to left order.

***
## Assignment 3
-	To compile ASM, use the gcc command.
-	`gcc -o pa3 main.c factorial.s`. in c code: `extern int factorial(int)`.

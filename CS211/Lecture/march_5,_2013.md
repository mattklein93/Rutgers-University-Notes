## Flow Control
### Condition Flags
```
	cf	carry	//Extra bit if 2 bits are added and are n+1
	zf	zero	//Equal or it is zero
	sf	sign	//If the result is 1, its either negative or a zero if it isnt negative
	of	overflow	//Twos complement from arithmetic
```
-	These are built in to the Intel architecture.

```
	cmp [BWLQ]	src,dst	//Non-destructive subtraction. 0 if they are the same. Subtracts source from destination.
	test [BWLQ] src,dst	//Non-destructive bitwise and.
```
-	Based on the condition flags, we can use them.

### Conditional Jumps
```
	==				JE	JZ		ZF
	!=				JNE	JNZ		~ZF
	signed >		JG	JNLE	~(SF^OF)&~ZF
	unsigned >		JA	JNBE 	~OF&~ZF	//Above
	signed <		JL	JNGE	SF^OF
	unsigned <		JB	JNAE 	CF	//Below
	signed >=					~(SF^OF)
	unsigned >=					~CF
	signed <=		JLE	JNG		(SF^OF)|ZF
	unsigned <=		JBE	JNA		OF|ZF	//Jump below equals
	Negative?		JS		
	Not Negative	JNS	
```
-	We jump to some target, that is labeled in the program. We can have multiple labels for the same thing.

### Unconditional Jumps
-	Can be direct **or** indirect.
-	For example, a direct jump: `jump .L37`. An indirect jump: `jmp *%eax	jmp *(%ebx)`. The `%ebx` register is memory, (hence the paranthesis). THe asterisk **signifies** an indirect jump.

### Translation
#### If-Else
```
if-else:
	movl	12(%ebp),%edx
	cmp		$3,%edx
	jne		elsepart
	.
	.
	jmp	done
elsepart:
	.
	.
done:
	.
	.
```
#### If (x & y)
```
if (x & y):
	movl	12(%ebp),%edx
	test	8(%ebp),%edx
	jz		else2
	.
	.
	jmp		done2
else2:
	.
	.
done2:
	.
	.
```
#### For Loop
```
for loop:
	movl	$1,%eax
top:
	cp		$10,%eax
	jge		done
	.		(Body)
	.		(of Loop)
	inc		%eax
	jmp		top
done:
	.
	.
```

## Problem Set 2
-	Remember the rule from last time, how to convert into it's [Two's Complement](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html)
-	For binary $$$\to$$$ decimal if binary is negative, subtract by 1 and invert to make positive if negative. Take all the 1's and do $$$2^n$$$ so we will get $$$256+128+16+32+4$$$ and since it is negative, put a negative sign in front. 
-	For binary $$$\to$$$ hex, 2 bits in binary is 1 bit in hex.

### Example 1

    $$
    There  is an 8 x 8 board, with 1 square covered already. You are given a 3 piece.
    Is it possible to cover the entire board with them?
    $$

-   Yes it is possible to cover then. So does 4 x 4.

    $$
    Each is 2^k. Assume that you are given a 2^k size board. Is it possible?
    $$

-   Yes, because if one is blocked off in a 4 x 4 you put what is missing in the middle. It is possible to build around what is missing. This is **induction**. It is also a **recursive **algorithm. 

    -   **Induction** - start simple and go up

    -   **Recursion **- start high up, and go down

### Example 2


Given a triangle, $\a^2 + b^2 = c^2\. $\a = 1\ and $\b = 1\. then $\c = sqrt(2)\.


    
    **Thm** - $\sqrt(2)\ is not a rational number
    

            -   Prove this without loss of generality

-   Suppose that sqrt(2) is a rational number. So, sqrt(2) is p/q and supposed that without loss of generality, that p and q have no common denominator.
